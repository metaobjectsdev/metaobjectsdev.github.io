# MetaObjects Features - Website Content

## Primary Features

### 1. Universal Metadata Architecture
**Headline**: Define Once, Deploy Everywhere
**Description**: Create a single metadata definition that automatically generates consistent implementations across all programming languages in your stack.
**Key Points**:
- Support for Java, C#, TypeScript, Python, Rust
- Automatic code generation
- Perfect consistency guaranteed
- No manual synchronization needed
**Code Example Display**:
```json
// One metadata definition
{
  "object": {
    "name": "Customer",
    "fields": [...]
  }
}
// Generates all language implementations automatically
```

### 2. Runtime System Adaptation
**Headline**: Zero Downtime Changes
**Description**: Modify your system behavior, add fields, and update business rules without rebuilding or redeploying services.
**Key Points**:
- Hot reload of metadata changes
- No service interruption
- Instant propagation across all services
- Production-safe modifications
**Visual**: Diagram showing traditional deploy vs runtime adaptation

### 3. Intelligent Code Generation
**Headline**: From Metadata to Production Code
**Description**: Advanced code generators create production-ready implementations with validation, serialization, and documentation.
**Key Points**:
- Maven plugin integration
- Multiple generator types (Java, TypeScript, API docs)
- Customizable templates
- Validation and business logic included

### 4. Enterprise Governance Built-In
**Headline**: Compliance and Security by Design
**Description**: Enterprise governance isn't an afterthought - it's built into the core architecture.
**Key Points**:
- Automatic audit trails
- Role-based access control
- PII data protection
- Compliance reporting
- Security policy enforcement

### 5. Cross-Language Validation
**Headline**: Consistent Validation Everywhere
**Description**: Define validation rules once and have them enforced consistently across all services and languages.
**Key Points**:
- Field-level validation
- Object-level validation
- Custom validation rules
- Same rules in frontend and backend

### 6. Metadata Overlay System
**Headline**: Extend Without Modifying
**Description**: Layer additional metadata for specific contexts without changing base definitions.
**Key Points**:
- Database-specific attributes
- UI presentation layers
- Environment-specific configs
- Clean separation of concerns
